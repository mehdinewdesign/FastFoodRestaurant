# Technical and structural design #

Below are technical details and software design architectures.

## Architectural Pattern ##

<strong>MVC (Model - View - Controller)</strong>

This project is written using MVC pattern for separations of concerns bacause you capability of loose coupling, all the layers are separated with their own functionality. It is easy to replace a layer with some other type of layer. In other words, MVC pattern is to break up UI behavior into separate pieces in order to increase reuse possibilities and testability.
